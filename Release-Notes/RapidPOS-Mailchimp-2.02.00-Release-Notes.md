## New Functionality  
  
### Mailchimp Customer Tag Syncing  
- Added support for **automated Mailchimp customer tags** based on customer data in Counterpoint.  
- Tags are defined using custom SQL queries such as **loyalty points** or **total customer spending**.  
- Synced tags can be used in Mailchimp for **campaign targeting**, **segmentation**, and **automated journeys**.  
  
#### Notes:  
- The connector can add tags to Mailchimp but it cannot remove them.  
- Tag removal can be handled using **Mailchimp Automations** (flows).  
- Tag configuration requires setup assistance from Rapid - billed at T&M rates.
